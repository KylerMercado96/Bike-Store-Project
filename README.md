# Bike_Store_Project

In this data analytics project, SQL, Excel, and Tableau were used to analyze and visualize sales data for a fictional bike retail company. The project involved collecting sales, customer, and internal business data from multiple sources and integrating it into a single database using SQL. 

Excel was used to clean and transform the data into an interacitve dashboard for executives to use. Tableau was then used to create an interactive dashboards and visualizations that presented the insights in a clear and compelling way. 

The project resulted in the stakeholders being able to identify key sales trends, including the most popular products, the highest-performing stores, and the most profitable regions.
